The first project is NTUST Fundamentals of Computer Graphics which is focused Matrix Transformation to move robot obj

This first project is done within 3 weeks, and is focused on loading OBJ and MTL files, 7 pre-assigned moves Animating by Manual Matrix Transformation, and also Lighting and Shadow calculation techniques using shaders. Here are each specific features and moves that are incorporated inside the demo program:
- OBJ Loading and Model Matrix Hierarchy Transformations with 21 Total Body parts
- 7 featured moves animations such as Walk (with displacement), Jumping Jack, Squat, Moon Walk, Gangnam Style Dance, Sit Up, and Push Up
- Wall Collision Detection
- GUI display using ImGUI, a really neat and practical GUI that can be used together with OpenGL
- Blinn Phong Point Lighting with three Lighting components, such as Ambient, Diffuse, and Specular, as well as Shininess Index.
- Shadow Mapping technique with Bias Shadow Acne Fix, Peterpanning fix, Oversampling Fix, and Neighbor PCF shadow Calculation
- Music Player using Irrklang for Ambient Noise, PSY - Gangnam Style, and also Michael Jackson - Billie Jean


3D Modelling Applications such as Blender and Maya are only allowed for pre-editing the model, and are forbidden to be used for animating moves and counting lighting calculation. All the main GUI design, 3D Models, dance movement such as Moon walk and Gangnam Style Dance, as well as musics are not owned by me and it was merely incorporated as the project's completion.
